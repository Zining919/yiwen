            <h2>The Story</h2>
            <p>
                The main idea for the logo was inspired by the shape of the recycle logo. Because green design is not only about bringing greenery into interior design but also about using recycling to present the symbol of caring for the environment and promoting green design. However, the main design of the logo is a combination of tiger, leaves, and water to form a circular shape that resembles a bad circle and responds to the importance of recycling. The overall design concept is that creatures live together peacefully on Earth, but as intelligent beings, we need to protect the resources that Mother Nature has given us. The tiger, the leaf, and the water are chosen to express the need to protect the ecosystem, the environment, and the water resources so that we can take care of nature.

                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>
                    With the innovations of the technological age, fewer and fewer people are becoming interested in the importance of caring for the environment. People may think that it is difficult to do their part for the environment, even in the long run. But the importance of protecting Mother Nature needs to be increasingly seen and appreciated to slow down the rate of pollution. Therefore, the easiest way to start is to bring green design into the design of the building industry and promote it slowly. Green design brings plants into our living spaces and uses recyclable or earth-friendly materials such as bamboo, cork, timber, etc. In addition, as a responsible citizen, we want to contribute to the conservation of nature. Don't underestimate the power of recycling, which can be applied to everything from the exterior of a building to its interior furniture and even appliances. People can incorporate green design into their buildings or use recycled or recycled furniture to add an artistic touch to their living spaces while doing their bit to help the environment. Secondly, builders and designers can bring green design into their buildings, not only for people who live in big cities for long periods but also for people who are stressed
